            <p class = "article_body">In this week's blog post, I am going to share the importance of designing a smooth onboarding user experience for mobile apps.
            
            <br><br>
                
            When a user downloads a new app or product, it is essential that the app is presented in a way that makes it easy for the user to understand how to use the app and determine what they will be getting out of the product. 
                
            <br><br>
            
            Alita Joyce, a UX Designer with the Nielsen Norman Group established a very clear definition of onboarding that I will share with you.</p>
                
            <br>

            <p class ="quote_2">"Onboarding is defined as the process of getting users familiar with a new interface, using dedicated flows and UI elements that are not part of the regular app interface."</p>
                
            <br>

            <p class = "article_body">During my internship this week, I have been asked to focus on creating a smooth and effective onboarding process for new users. After careful examination, I established that the onboarding process for an app includes four key steps:</p>
            
            <br>
        
            <div class = "article_body">
                <ol>
                    <li>introducing the app's main goal and purpose</li>
                    <li>educate users on the app's main features and what it can do</li>
                    <li>presenting the app's subscription model</li>
                    <li>getting users set up with the app by signing in or creating an account</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
                
            <br>
                
                <p class = "article_body">Through this experience, I learned a lot about how essential it is to create an effective and enjoyable onboarding experience for users. Here are the steps that I followed: </p>
                
            <br><br>
               
                
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">Competitor Research</h1>
        
            <p class = "article_body">It is essential to do research on competitors and their onboarding process. This will allow you to learn from their strengths and improve on their weaknesses to gain a competitive advantage. Some questions to consider in your research:</p> 
            
            <br>

            <div class = "article_body">
                <ol>
                    <li>What are the other apps that I am competing with?</li>
                    <li>How are my competitors onboarding their users? Are they successful?</li>
                    <li>How do they educate the user on their app's features?</li>
                    <li>How are they presenting the payment plans and subscription offers?</li>
                    <li>How do they keep their users engaged?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
                
            <br><br>
                
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">User Interviews</h1>
        
            <p class = "article_body">In UX, we all know how important it is to talk to users and understand their needs and pain points. This step is critical. Go out and conduct user interviews to connect with your consumers. Ask questions related to their overall onboarding journey with your app or even other apps. If your app offers subscription plans, make sure to ask users about that as well. Some questions I asked in my interviews included:  

                <br>
                
                <div class = "article_body">
                <ol>
                    <li>Tell me about the most recent app you downloaded and the process of signing up with that app.</li>
                    <li>What was the overall experience for you?</li>
                    <li>What felt smooth about onboarding with the app?</li>
                    <li>Was there any step in the onboarding process that felt overwhelming or confusing?</li>
                    <li>What information are you hoping to gain when you are getting set up with a new app you download?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel when you are prompted with a subscription offer when you first download an app?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel about being offered free trials before paying a subscription price?</li>
                    <li>When in the onboarding process would you like to be presented with a sign up/create an account page? Does it matter?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        
                <p class = "article_body">These are just some examples, but ask anything that pertains to your product!</p>

            <br><br>
        
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">User Journey Flow Charts</h1>

                <p class = "article_body">After gaining a better understanding of what the users are looking for and how you can present that information, it helps to create a few different user journey flow charts. You can take inspiration from your competitors or design a completely new onboarding user flow that aligns with your product. Make sure to incorporate the insights you reached into these user flows!</p>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">Wireframes and Prototypes</h1>

                <p class = "article_body">Based on your user journey flow charts, you can then create low-fidelity wireframes that follow the flow and create mockups of what each screen will look like. I would recommend making 4-5 different user flows. The more you have to test, the better! Make each user flow wireframe into a clickable prototype to prepare you for testing with users.</p>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">User Research and A/B Testing</h1>

                <p class = "article_body">After creating your low fidelity prototypes, it is a great time to go and test these out with users. Observing users as they interact with the different prototypes and asking questions as you go along allows you to understand which onboarding flow the user has the best experience with. Ask questions about the pros and cons of each flow and see if a user can choose one that they like best. Here are a few questions I asked in my A/B testing session:</p>
                    
                <br>
    
                <div class = "article_body">
                <ol>
                    <li>Where should the signup page go in the onboarding process? Does it feel abrupt when it is the first screen you see?</li>
                    <li>Do you like buttons in user flow #3?  Do you find this page with this personalized question and the buttons engaging?</li>
                    <li>Are the two product explanation screens helpful? Do you think they are needed for the onboarding process or would you prefer to go without them?</li>
                    <li>Does the onboarding process feel too long?</li>
                    <li>If you could choose 1 out of the 5 presented onboarding flows, which one would you choose?</li>
                </ol>
                </div>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">High Fidelity Prototypes</h1>

                <p class = "article_body">After running through your prototypes with users and conducting A/B testing sessions, you will get a better sense of what your users are looking for and which user flow they prefer. From there, you can use their feedback to create a higher fidelity prototype of the onboarding flow. In this stage, you can focus more on the visual design and UI elements to perfect the onboarding process. Feel free to run more user interviews and tests! Once you have refined and reiterated enough times based on user research, you are now ready to incorporate the finalized onboarding process into your app.</p>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">Summary</h1>

                <p class = "article_body">Onboarding is a key stage in the user journey because it is the first interaction that a user has with your app. If it goes poorly, your user may be turned off. If it goes well, your user will be more excited to get started with the app, will continue using the app, and perhaps even recommend it to others. 
                
                <br><br>

                The onboarding process sets the tone for the overall experience your user has with your product. It sounds overwhelming, I know. Although, if you follow these steps, conduct user research, refine, and reiterate, you will be all set!

                Before wrapping up this post, I want to share the main takeaways that I learned as I worked on perfecting the onboarding process for mobile app users during my internship.</p>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">My Takeaways</h1>
            <div class = "article_body">
                <ul>
                    <li>People have short attention spans, so don't make the onboarding process too long. Keep it as simple as possible!</li>
                    <li>It is super important for the entire process to flow smoothly. Don't present any signup pages or payment plans too soon in the onboarding process.</li>
                    <li>Before designing your onboarding process, think about the features of the app you want to highlight and what makes your app unique. Make sure to incorporate that in the flow.</li>
                    <li>During user testing sessions, you will reach the most valuable insights by physically being with the user and watching them interact with the onboarding process of the app.</li>
                    <li>Make it personal! Customize the onboarding process to create a personal experience for users! Ask questions that encourage the user to think about their needs and show them how those needs can be met with your product.</li>
