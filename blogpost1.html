            <p class = "article_body">On a warm summer day, my 15-year-old self went to my local library to read with my Dad. Little did I know, my path towards my future career was started simply by walking into the library that day.
            
            <br><br>

            About an hour into reading, my Dad looked up at me and said “Vida, tell me about a current problem in your life that you want to solve.” As an engineer with passions for entrepreneurship, my Dad was always trying to teach me how to have a creative, problem-solving mindset. I was initially annoyed that my Dad caused me to lose my spot in my book, but was intrigued by his question and decided to give it some thought.
            
            <br><br>

            At the time, one of my favorite hobbies was photography. I had a fancy Nikon camera and loved taking pictures of my friends and family, scenery, food, and anything else I felt inspired by.
            
            <br><br>

            I told my Dad some of the problems that I faced as a photographer, but there was one that really stood out to me: I struggled to narrow down my best pictures from the thousands of pictures I took. I ran over to the whiteboard and began jotting down all my ideas. After spending the entire day at the library, I told my Dad I wanted to try to build an app as a potential solution to this problem. My Dad laid out the stages that I needed to take if I wanted to take this idea to the next level. The plan looked something like this: define the problem, conduct research, interview potential customers, create one potential solution, and finally, test that product. If my solution was successful amongst users, I was ready to launch it. But if not, I would continue the cycle again, until the product was ready. This is when my journey into design and entrepreneurship began.
                
            <br><br>
                
            While I was learning something new every step of the way and enjoyed the entire process, the stage of conducting user research interviews and designing the product stood out to me the most.
                
            <br><br>

            When I realized that I could design to solve problems and create delightful experiences for users, I knew I wanted to be a designer.
                
            <br><br>

            To build an app that would streamline the process of choosing photos, I began by conducting interviews with users who I felt could be facing this problem. I enjoyed empathizing with users and talking to them in order to get a better understanding of their frustrations and needs. After the interviews, I began creating wireframes for the app. I initially drew the screens by hand using my childhood colored pencil collection, then dove into learning how to use professional design tools such as Sketch, Figma, and InVision. After a year of learning and iterating, I created all the designs for the app.
            
            <br><br>

            The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the app was built and launched in the App Store prior to graduating high school.  
            
            <br><br>

            Throughout the entire journey of creating this product, I learned that there was an entire world of UX/UI design and design thinking. I envisioned myself with a career in this field, but knew there was still so much more to learn.
            
            <br><br>

            Throughout the college application process, I discovered the unique major of Integrated Digital Media offered at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and completely fell in love with it.
                
            <br><br>

            Flash forward 3 years and I am in my third year at NYU majoring in Integrated Digital Media, where I have been able to bring together my passions for design and technology. My educational career at NYU has allowed me to dive into the field of UX/UI design through outstanding classes and hands-on projects.
                
            <br><br>

            This field has taught me skills in empathy, design, collaboration, and communication that I am  able to apply to my internships and jobs, but also to my everyday life.
            
            <br><br>

            That is my journey to this fascinating  field. And it all started on a typical summer day while I was sitting in a library with my dad.

            Now that you know my story, share yours with me.
