            <p class = "article_body">In the design world today, the term Design Thinking has become very prominent. But, what does it actually mean? How can we apply this new transformative way of thinking to UX? 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Tim Brown, the chairman of IDEO coined the term "design thinking" and defined it as follows: 
                
            <br><br><br>
                
            <p class ="quote">"Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success."</p>
            
            <br><br><br>

                <p class = "article_body">There's a lot going on there, right? Let's break this down. </p>
                
                <br>

                <p class ="quote_2">1. "Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation..."</p>
                
                <br>

                    <p class = "article_body">What does it mean to be human-centered? This just means that innovation is powered through the understanding of human behavior, needs, and preferences. This approach places humans at the center and prioritizes empathy in order to better understand the emotional world of users.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p class ="quote_2">2. "...that draws from the designer's toolkit"</p> 
                
                <br>

                    <p class = "article_body">Design thinking puts the skills, methods, and capabilities of designers to use. This includes empathy, integrative thinking, optimism, experimentalism, and collaboration.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p class ="quote_2">3. "...to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success"</p>
                
                <br>

                    <p class = "article_body">Design thinking unites technology with human needs in order to create business strategies that deliver success for both customers and businesses. This results in emotional and functional solutions that creates both customer benefit and business value.</p>
            
            <br><br>
                
            <h1 class = "sub_title">The Design Thinking Process</h1>
        
            <br>
        
            <p class = "article_body">There are various ways of mapping out the design thinking process, but they all follow this basic framework:
                
            <br><br>

            1. Inspiration — finding a problem or opportunity that inspires change
                <br><br>
            2. Ideation — generating, iterating, and testing ideas of possible solutions
                <br><br>
            3. Implementation — creating a path to bring the solution to the market
                <br><br>

            I will be sharing the four stages of design thinking that I learned in my Design Thinking class, which reflects my design process.
                
                <br><br>

            The four stages are:</p><p class = "article_body" style = "font-style:italic">discover, define, develop, and deliver.</p>
                
                <br><br>

                <p class ="sub_sub_title">--> Discover</p>
                
                <br>

                 <p class = "article_body">This stage consists of conducting interviews and research to better understand users. This process begins with territory mapping or the act of writing out the future reality and goals of a project. 
                
                <br><br>

                The most important step of this process is establishing A “How Might We” question. This step reframes a problem as a question, which sparks innovative thinking by confirming that a solution is possible. 
                
                <br><br>

                Example: "How might we make ice cream shops more inviting for customers?"
                
                <br><br>

                The “How Might We” question is used to launch brainstorming and guides the direction of research.
                
                <br><br>

                After brainstorming, you are free to begin the process of conducting surveys and design research, the most exciting part of the discover stage. Research guides are created to establish the research objectives and methodologies. These guides help a design thinker plan out the questions they ask their interviewees to better understand their world. 
                
                <br><br>

                Digging deep with well-thought out questions during interviews ensures conversations that lead to interesting insights. The discover stage highlights the importance of empathy and listening to users.</p>
                
                <br><br>

                <p class ="sub_sub_title">--> Define</p>
                
                <br>

                <p class = "article_body">Following the discover stage is the define stage, where most of the “ah-ha” moments happen. 
                
                <br><br>

                In the define stage, research and interviews are brought together to finalize valuable insights. Interviews are synthesized and put together on Journey Maps. Journey Maps take information from the interviews and highlight the moments in a user’s journey. The user's thoughts, emotions, and actions are organized along each phase. 
                
                <br><br>

                Journey maps are used to spark brainstorming sessions for potential solutions to the problem statement. The process requires rapidly producing ideas, collaborating, and being open to “wild” ideas. The most effective brainstorming sessions are visual and incorporate Post-it Notes or drawings. Most importantly, these sessions involve critiquing and building on each other’s ideas. 
                
                <br><br>

                At the end of this stage, all the ideas from the brainstorming session are streamlined into a few possible solutions. A concept poster is created that presents a storyboard of the proposed solution and highlights how it benefits the user.</p>
                
                <br><br>

                <p class ="sub_sub_title">--> Develop</p>
                
                <br>

                <p class = "article_body">Once a proposed solution has been established, it is time to create it and that is what the develop stage is all about. 
                
                <br><br>

                Prototyping is the defining factor of this stage and involves bringing your ideas to life and then refining them. It is a playful, iterative process that allows you to create a test of your product before creating the actual product. Why is this important? It is cheap and provides you with valuable feedback on your solution before you have invested too fully into it. 
                
                <br><br>

                Creating a prototype allows you to shape your ideas and share it with your users. Watching how they interact with the prototype gives you valuable feedback, which can be used to refine and modify your solution. The different ways to prototype are endless, but some examples include sketches and storyboards, physical models, and mock interfaces. 
                
                <br><br>

                Designs should never be created once and finished, it is rather an iterative and cyclical process. Prototyping allows for that.</p>
                
                <br><br>

                <p class ="sub_sub_title">--> Deliver</p>

                <br>
                
                <p class = "article_body">Once the prototype has been iterated and refined, you are ready to enter the final stage.
                
                <br><br>

                When you feel that you have found the best solution that targets the specific needs of the user and have a refined prototype, you can develop the solution into a real product or service. This can either be in the form of a web application, mobile application, pilot program, or even a physical object. 
                
                <br><br>

                The entire design process has brought you to this final stage where you have created a groundbreaking and innovative solution.
                
                <br><br>

                But remember, this process is a cycle!</p>

            <h1 class = "sub_title">Design Thinking & UX</h1>
        
            <br>

            <p class = "article_body">A UX designer’s goals are to understand a user -- their needs, motivations, frustrations, and their entire emotional world in order to solve their problems and create experiences they love. But, how do UX designers do this?
                
            <br><br>

            Empathy. 
                
            <br><br>

            The fascinating ability we have as humans, which allows us to put ourselves in the shoes of another individual and identify with what they are feeling. 
                
            <br><br>

            Design thinking is a toolset that UX designers can use in junction with empathy to develop more innovative and human-centered design solutions. 
                
            <br><br>

            As a UX Designer, whether you are creating user personas, journey maps, clickable prototypes, or designing the screens of a website or mobile app, design thinking is extremely beneficial for designing user-friendly solutions. Through an iterative and collaborative process full of Post-it Notes, flow charts, diagrams, and explanatory models, design thinking allows UX designers to reframe problems and focus on the users.
            
            <br><br>

            Design thinking represents the chance to turn UX designers into leaders and creative problem solvers.</p>
                
            <br><br>
                
            <h1 class = "sub_title">Bringing It All Together</h1>
                
            <br>

            <p class = "article_body">Design thinking is essentially channeling the childlike curiosity within you and looking at the world through a fresh set of eyes. Mastering this new way of thinking affects all aspects of your lives--the way you do things, see things, and think about things. It is a problem-solving approach that involves immersing yourself in the problem. 
                
            <br><br>

            The benefits to this way of thinking are endless; it encourages collaboration between users and designers, supports empathy, sparks novel ideas, and helps validate ideas before building. It brings together problem-solving, technology, design, and business in a way that is biased towards action. 
                
            <br><br>

            Design thinking is a methodology that sets your users and your solution up for success.</p>
