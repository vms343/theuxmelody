            <p class = "article_body">In one of my classes this week, we listened to David Foster Wallace's college graduation speech "This is Water". If you haven't listened to it yet, I would encourage you to do so. 
            
            <br><br>
                
            In his speech, Wallace uses the term "Natural Default Setting", a concept that I have been reflecting upon and trying to make sense of myself. 
                
            <br><br>
            
            I have come to believe that the term “Natural Default Setting" describes the subconscious mind of human beings. It refers to our ego-oriented state that keeps us concerned with ourselves and blocks us from expanding our consciousness and learning new perspectives. 
                
            <br><br>

            When we are young, we carry the belief that we are the "absolute center of the universe". As we grow older, we continue to carry this self-centered mindset into our daily lives. In an attempt to make sense of who we are and the world around us, certain experiences we face cause us to create certain beliefs about ourselves and the world. We subconsciously take in information that confirms our view of the world, but discount information that disproves that perspective. This includes our perspectives on love, relationships, money, success, happiness, our sense of self, and people in our surrounding environment. 
                
            <br><br>

            Over time, this way of thinking becomes <i>automatic</i> to us and we lose the ability to step outside of ourselves. But, once we recognize that we can <i>control our thoughts</i>, we realize that we have the power to <i>decide the meaning and significance</i> that we give to things. We have the choice to look at experiences differently and to be compassionate towards others. True wisdom and freedom comes when we become aware of our preprogrammed beliefs, but choose to let them go. 
            
            <br><br>
                
            Although, as Wallace admitted himself, maintaining this mindset to life takes practice and is definitely not easy to do. 
                
            <br><br>
                
            Through the process of observing and becoming mindful of my own thoughts, I have been working on releasing selfish perspectives. While I have lots of room for improvement, freeing myself from my "Natural Default Setting" has allowed me to work on being more empathetic and open-minded. 
                
            <br><br>
               
                
            <h1 class = "sub_sub_title">Thinking about UX Design</h1>
        
            <br>
        
            <p class = "article_body"> As UX designers, we must practice <i>empathy</i> and an <i>openness to different perspectives</i> when we are designing for people. If we approached design with our "Natural Default Setting", we would become so absorbed in our own perspectives about the problem that we would fail to connect with our users and understand their needs. It is easy to assume that we already know what our users need and become biased towards our solution. But, true designers understand the value in empathizing with users to design the best possible solution.
            
            <br><br>

            This is the basis of <i>human-centered design</i>, which requires UX designers to break out of this "Natural Default Setting" and immerse themselves in the world of their users. 
                
            <br><br>
                
            I will now leave you with my favorite quote from Wallace's speech: </p>
        
            <br>
            
            <p class ="quote_2">“You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. That is real freedom. That is being educated and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race.”</p>
